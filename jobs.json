We have captured our industrys interest and attention. Executives from ARM, Amazon, Dell, Facebook and Red Hat touting our new direction are a direct reflection of the industry readiness to support and embrace this shift. ARM Technology coupled with AMDs SeaMicro Freedom Fabric will give us leadership to handle exploding data workloads the Cloud is creating, with the benefit of low-power optimization. This will uniquely position us to become the leader in the low-power dense server space. Well accelerate our roadmap expansion to include designs for the higher growth dense server market enabled by both 64-bit ARM and X86 solutions, and expect to bring our first ARM-based solutions to market in 2014.AMD announced its collaboration with Microsoft and key OEM partners to power more than 125 PC designs across a multitude of form factors, including tablets, ultrathin and mainstream notebooks, all-in-one and traditional desktops, home theater PCs and embedded designs. With an all new, hardware accelerated user interface, Windows 8 is specifically optimized to unlock the high performance graphics capabilities found in AMD APUs and discrete AMD Radeon GPUsAs we move more fully into the gaming, industrial and communications markets, the dense cloud server markets and the ultraportable and ultra-low-power form factors that continue to grow rapidly, we have opportunities for key contributors in Design for APUs and GPUs for these markets.We are continuing to invest in graphics IP; both in low power architecture and to improve performance/W/mm^2If the thought of playing a bigger role, or contributing where an individual has direct impact to the bottom-line, or perhaps its time to leverage your career  into a superior role, the Director of Engineering is available to talk about these and any other  points of interest.Regardless of the challenges we face, we will push forward and will meet these challenges with the passion and innovation that is at the heart of AMD. This position is for a design engineer in AMDs graphics group working on next-generation high performance graphics architectures. Responsibilities will include test planning, testbench creation, test writing, debug, and documentation.  While you probably have completed 2-3 full product development cycles with 5+ years  of experience in the large ASIC designs,  were more interested in what youve accomplished.  Experience in the following areas is valuable:         High performance processor designs, particularly highly parallel compute systems; GPUs, CPUs, DSPs or other novel systems         Cache systems, particularly multiple level caches and multiprocessor cache schemes          High performance graphics hardware architecture A great background for this role will include the following experience:Architecture and micro-architecture developmentRTL coding and debugIntegration of 3rd party IPVerification plan, test case and test bench developmenSynthesis and timing methodologyLab equipment such as high-speed digital oscilloscopes and logic analyzerSilicon bring-upProgramming of embedded processor systemsProgramming languages: Verilog, C/C++, scripting (Perl, Python, TCL) I can be reached at daniel.gieber@amd.comLinkedIn profile  http://www.linkedin.com/in/gieber"}

{"topic": "map-reducing", "jobDescription": "Job description We are seeking interested candidates for a Post Doctoral Researcher position at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY. We are particularly looking for candidates who have experience in the areas of Systems Research. Experience in the areas of Solid-state Disks (SSD), Flash memories and Analytics oriented system or application design will be considered valuable.IBM Research conducts genuine scientific research and develops technologies and processes for use with IBM products and customer applications. IBM is a leading manufacturer of computer hardware and a leading provider of products and services that relate to the full software life cycle, including infrastructure, hosting, and consulting services. IBM Research fosters close partnerships with other IBM divisions thereby providing a real-world basis for our research.IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center offers a unique opportunity to work with top-notch Research Scientists on cutting-edge technologies. The Commercial Systems department performs state-of-the-art research in all areas of systems research spanning the entire computer system stack, from processor and memory architecture to commercial middleware for next generation systems. In addition to research, the department also has a strong track record of making significant contributions to IBM products.The Post Doctoral Program is highly-competitive and seeks applications from students world-wide. As a Post Doctoral Researcher, one is expected to independently conduct novel research, come up with innovative ideas, publish papers and translate them into IBM products. Area of Research: SSD-AnalyticsAnalytics is increasingly becoming an important requirement for businesses and organizations. Applications of analytics have touched almost every aspect of our lives including web-searches, movie and book preferences, health management, marketing optimizations, etc. Trend identification using dynamic data lies at the crux of the required real-time decision making here. Challenge to such decision making is not only handling data that is large and unstructured, but also noisy and uncertain. Adding to this, today's data generation speed, and demand to provide real-time solutions makes this analysis all the more complex. One of the key system stack technologies that facilitates handling large amounts of data (Big-Data) at faster speed is Solid-state Disk (SSD). Over the past few years, as the prices came down, SSDs have become very prominent on both personal and enterprise fronts. However, the implications of SSDs on Analytics (and vice-versa: SSD Design for Analytics) is not well understood. Novel research ideas here include investigating novel designs for SSDs for Analytics/Big-data workloads (considering both performance and endurance of SSDs), offloading Analytics work onto SSDs, use of SSDs in large scale and its implications, design of analytics applications on SSDs, etc. This Post Doctoral position is aimed at not only identifying such areas of research, but creating this new field of Flash-Analytics and conducting deep and thorough research. A good number of publications, patents and potentially product impact and leadership in the area are expected as outcome.  Required  Bachelor's Degree  At least 3 years experience in Performance Evaluation and Analysis  English: Intermediate    Preferred  Doctorate Degree in Information Technology  At least 4 years experience in Knowledge of Operating Systems, Device Drivers and Kernel-level software  At least 2 years experience in Storage systems knowledge (Solid-state disks and FLASH memories will be a plus)  At least 1 year experience in Familiarity with Analytics oriented frameworks such as Map-Reduce, Hadoop, etc.(Knowledge of Analytics algorithms will be a plus  English : Fluent    IBM is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
